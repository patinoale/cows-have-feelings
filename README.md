## About

Sometimes delicious vegan meals can be hard to find. This is an app where users can explore and share their thoughts on meals they have tried or made themselves. 

On this app a user can create, update, or delete a review that includes a title, opinion, rating, image link, and a link to the recipe or yelp page.

The user can also comment and rate other reviews.I created this app to make delicious vegan meals more accessible. Bon Appetit!
